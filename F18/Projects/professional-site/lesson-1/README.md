## 2. Technologies & Tools

### 1. HTML
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the language we will use to structure and define our web page. 

Each HTML file is one web page and vice versa.

HTML by itself looks bland, but we can fix that with CSS.

### 2. CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is the language we use to style our HTML to make it look more interesting.

CSS allows you to make your web page less boring by adding colours, adjusting text sizes, moving pictures, and more!

Writing HTML and CSS all by yourself is time-consuming, but we can speed things up with Bootstrap 4.

### 3. Bootstrap 4
Bootstrap 4 is a styling framework, meaning Bootstrap is a lot of HTML and CSS bundled together for easier use. Think of Bootstrap as "HTML and CSS but with shortcuts", except you need to understand the basics of HTML and CSS in order to use the shortcuts properly.

Bootstrap 4 allows you to make responsive web pages more easily, meaning the web pages will look good on different screen sizes such as your phone, tablet, laptop, or TV.

We will install Bootstrap 4 in a future lesson.

### 4. JavaScript
JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to add behaviour to your website.

We will use JavaScript to make buttons that will filter our side projects based on categories.

JavaScript is powerful, but most of our web site will be using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

### 5. jQuery
jQuery is a JavaScript library, meaning jQuery is a lot of JavaScript bundled together for easier use, just like how Bootstrap is a lot of HTML and CSS bundled together.

jQuery makes it easier to update your web page contents by modifying HTML.

We will install jQuery in a future lesson. 

## 3. Coding


```html
<html>
	<h1>hello world, my name is Michael!</h1>
</html>
```
