# Arduino Automatic Coffee Stirrer Hardware Project

Build, from scratch, an automatic coffee stirrer powered by your very own Arduino system.  No need to bring your own hardware as Coffee â€˜N Code will lend you kit.

## Objective
* Learn to read circuit schematics
* Design a complex electronic system
* Use general purpose input/output to control an Arduino

## Tools and Technologies
