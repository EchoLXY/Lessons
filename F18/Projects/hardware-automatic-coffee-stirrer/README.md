# Arduino Automatic Coffee Stirrer Hardware Project

Build, from scratch, an automatic coffee stirrer powered by your very own Arduino system.  No need to bring your own hardware as Coffee â€˜N Code will lend you kit.

## Objective
* Learn to read circuit schematics
* Design a complex electronic system
* Use general purpose input/output to control an Arduino

## Tools and Technologies
* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
* [Arduino Simulator for Web](https://www.tinkercad.com/circuits)
**OR**
[Arduino Simulator for Windows](https://www.sites.google.com/site/unoardusim/services)
* [Arduino Code support](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples)

## Summary of material covered so far
Use this section as a resource if you are behind and are looking to catch up!

Don't worry about fully understanding every detail. It is important that you have something working, and once you are caught up you can ask a project lead to go over the theory.

1. Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
    - This is where you will write and deploy all of your programs.
2. Start by wiring an LED, and get it to turn on and off with code.
    - Use the schematic and the code on [the Arduino site](https://www.arduino.cc/en/tutorial/blink)
3. Once you have the led flashing. Try to get a servo to move!
    - Use the schematic and the code on [the Arduino site](https://www.arduino.cc/en/tutorial/sweep)
4. Now that your servo is moving. You are going to need something to control it. Pick from one of the three sensors, and use the sample code provided via the link to get it working.
