# Meet-Up #4 Agenda:

**Objective**: Create a circuit diagram of your project, and work with some sensors!

## 1. Sensors
Now that we have our output working (the servo), it is time for some more complicated inputs!
Here are the sensors you can use. Pick your favourite!

**Ultrasonic sensor**: Detects distance.

**Sound sensor**: Detects sound.

**Joystick**: Analog directional input.

**Keypad**: Multi button input.

We also have additional sensors and output. If you want an additional challenge ask a Project Lead!

## 2. Learning
**What is a circuit diagram**

[From Wikipedia: ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_diagram)
*A circuit diagram (electrical diagram, elementary diagram, electronic schematic) is a graphical representation of an electrical circuit. A pictorial circuit diagram uses simple images of components, while a schematic diagram shows the components and interconnections of the circuit using standardized symbolic representations. *

We aren't going to be creating an exact circuit schematic, but it will be a model of your circuit that will be useful to reference.

**How do you create a circuit diagram?**

You can use the Tinkercad Arduino simulator to build your circuit and use it as a reference.

## 3. SENSORS!

Once you have your circuit schematic then start to build your circuit! If you are unfamiliar with your sensor try to find some examples online or on the Arduino website.
