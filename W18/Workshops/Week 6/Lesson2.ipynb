It tries to make the least number of decisions for the user, as opposed to another popular Python library, Django (which has its use cases as well!). Flask uses Werkzeug, another Python library, as its Web Server Gateway Interface; essentially the way it communicates with the web. It also uses Jinja 2 as its HTML templating engine, a way to programmatically generate HTML (the language of web pages!).\n",
