# Credit Card Fraud with Machine Learning Project

We will be looking into a data set contains 280000 credit card transactions ,and building a model that will catch the fraud transaction in the furture.

### Learning Objectives

* Learn the Basic concept of ML and DS
* Build a ML model

Have your first taste of machine learning. Artificial Intelligence is being used widely in the software industry today, let's learn a bit about how it works!

### Tools and Technologies
Jupyter Notebook : A powerful environment for data science project
Anaconda: free and open-source Python package management
Python 3.6 as the language to power our project
