#### Introductions

My name is Bryen Xie, and I'll be taking you through this credit card project. We will be going from Zero knowledge of programming to building an Machine Learning Model. There is no prerequiste knowledge for being here, just be willing to learn.

### What is Machine Learning?
Putting in simple: showing a machine what `s an number looks, then machine will form a model that can identify the pattern of this number.

So next time, when toss another number in, it will tells whether this number is the same one as before.


### Why do Machine Learning?
Machine learning is certainly one of the hottest topic the in tech industry.

Because Machine are a lot better on computational work compare to human.

There are tons of great product are powered by machine learning, (Google Search Engine, Self-driving-car, Youtube video recommendation.

#### Software

Okay, there is the most annoying part, so don`t freak out if you find this part this struggle. Because everybody do.

Let`s Install Anaconda first

Switch into Python 3.6

#### Linear Regression

Linear Regression is one of the most common, some 200 years old and most easily understandable in statistics and machine learning. As explained in the previous post it comes under predictive modelling. Predictive modelling is a kind of modelling here the possible output(Y) for the given input(X) is predicted based on the previous data or values.

Here the main aim is to find the best fit line, which minimizes error(the sum of the square of the distance between points and the line). The distance between the points and line are taken and each of them is squared to get rid of negative values and then the values are summed which gives the error which needs to be minimized.

#### Building a Linear Regression Model

Lets predict the price of a house based on the size of it.
