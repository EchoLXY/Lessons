# Coffee 'N Code Fall 2019 Project List

### Game Dev 1
**Unity 3D Space Shooter:** A fun, old school arcade style scrolling space shooter. We will be making the game from scratch, and learning how to program gameplay elements, import and use art in our game, and make UI all inside of the Unity engine!

### Game Dev 2
**Colorbound:** A fast-paced rougelike 2d game and engine created from scratch using JavaScript and HTML5. We will be using an incremental approach to simultaneously build a fun and engaging game as well as an engine which you can customize and use to create your own games in the future!

### Back-End Web Dev
**SMS Morning Newsfeed:** Learn how to use Python to collect information from the web and text yourself a daily newsfeed. In this completely beginner friendly project we'll first start out with getting the local weather, but then help you find other info you might want to get for your own custom newsfeed.

### Machine Learning 1
**Credit card fraud detection:** It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. We will be using python build a machine learning model based on a 284,807  transactions dataset.

### Machine Learning 2
**Hate Speech Detection Engine:** We will be diving into the world of machine learning and natural language processing to build a model that can classify harmful text. We will be exploring an impactful problem that social media giants such as Facebook and Quora are currently working on.

### Hardware
**Automatic Coffee Stirrer:** Build, from scratch, an automatic coffee stirrer powered by your very own Arduino system. No need to bring your own hardware as Coffee â€˜N Code will lend you kit. Learn to read circuit schematics, design a complex electronic system, and use external libraries to control an Arduino.
