# Unity 3D Space Shooter
We will be building an old school arcade style shooter using the Unity 3D game engine. You will be able to control your player, shoot at enemies and hazards, and get a nice score for all your hard work at the end of a run. This project is meant to build a foundation for game development inside the Unity engine, and give you a boiler plate to build out whatever game design ideas you may have!

You will learn how to use the Unity engine, do a bit of programming, learn how to import art into your games, and deploy your game to be played on a PC or Mac.
