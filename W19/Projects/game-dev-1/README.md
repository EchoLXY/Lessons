# Unity 3D Space Shooter
We will be building an old school arcade style shooter using the Unity 3D game engine. You will be able to control your player, shoot at enemies and hazards, and get a nice score for all your hard work at the end of a run. This project is meant to build a foundation for game development inside the Unity engine, and give you a boiler plate to build out whatever game design ideas you may have!

You will learn how to use the Unity engine, do a bit of programming, learn how to import art into your games, and deploy your game to be played on a PC or Mac.

## Summary of Lessons so far

Up until Lesson 4 we have covered a variety of topics, most of which were related to building individual game systems and objects.

We started with building our game space which involved:
- Importing our art assets and creating our background
- Building the player GameObject
- Lighting our scene

Then we went on to create a variety of scripts for our player, lazer bolts, and scrolling our background. We used a variety of Unity engine features and classes such as:
- Screen to World Space transformation
- The Rigidbody component
- Collider programming and logic
- Managing, and creating good Prefabs

We then ended off by bringing all of our features together and controlling the overall logic for our entire game in the Game Controller.
