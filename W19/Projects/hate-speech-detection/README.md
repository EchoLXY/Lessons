# Hate Speech Detection
We are building a machine learning system that can automate the detection of hate speech. This is a current problem that engineers at big social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Quora are working on.

Through this project, you will learn the fundementals of machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and artificial intelligence (AI) while working on an interesting and impactful problem.

The best part of all? **No pre-requisite knowledge is required!** All skill levels are welcome :)

## Learning Objectives

- Learn what *exactly* is machine learning, what problems it can solve, and how it works

- Learn the end-to-end process of developing an industry-quality machine learning solution

- Have fun and meet new people in relaxed yet still educational environment
